## Resources

There's much effort  across many GC departments to analyze and visualize  geo-data. This discussion is the place to share your results, ideas or problems related to the problem.

 

Below is a great resource to start, which also provides a nice explanation on why R is believed to be the best language to do this kind of work. 

 
Geocomputation with R, a book on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling.


The online version of the book is hosted at https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net and kept up-to-date by GitHub Actions

 
## Federal Geospatial Platform

From https://gcconnex.gc.ca/discussion/view/84695812/data-federation-federation-des-donnees

 

Yukonâ€™s open geospatial data is now searchable on the Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP) (https://gcgeo.gc.ca/) and on Government of Canada Open Maps Portal. Check it out !

 

With the addition of Yukon's resources, the FGP now offers over 5,000 datasets available to discover and download, for public servants and Canadians, all in one location.

 

Wondering how to create a map with your data? We can help you do so, from A to Z, at no cost. Contact us at nrcan.geoinfo.rncan@canada.ca

 
## Tutorials

## Dealing with memory issues

A blog post that illustrates a few ways to avoid overloading R's memory when working with large spatial objects (here's looking at you, 30-m land cover map of North America!).

The two other posts on that blog also have some really nice tips for general R coding. 


## Canadian geo-data

Useful code and R packages from public domain to work with Canadian geo-data.
