# R Markdown for literate programming and automated reports

This discussion thread is for gathering knowledgebase related to R Markdown: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

It can be used to generate reports, slides, websites, dashboards, shiny app, books, emails.
It is the tools allows you to do [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), which -- as defined by Donald Knuth - is the type of programming  where human language is combined with  computer language, making the code much easier understood by  your colleagues and yourself and  coding much more fun.

## Automated generation of multiple PDF files

Question:
"Can we automatically generate multiple PDF files using R RMarkdown? E.g. 20 report cards in PDF format, each showing results for 50 different parameters of the analysis?"

Answer: "Absolutely!" - This is what RMarkdown is developed for.


Here's a tiny  R script example showing how to do it.

```
# report_generator.R

mvndr_nm <- c('name1', 'name2', 'name3', 'name4', 'name5', 'name6')
mvndr_nbr<- c('60031167', '60688509', '60074051', '60148060', '60086898', '60080204')

for (i in seq_along(mvndr_nm)) {
  rmarkdown::render("C:/Users/santi/Documents/R Scripts/Export_Data_CSV.Rmd",
                    output_file = sprintf("MVNDR_%s.html", mvndr_nbr[i]),
                    params = list(MVNDR_NBR = mvndr_nbr[i], MVNDR_NM = mvndr_nm[i]))
}

# Export_Data_CSV.Rmd
# (remove # and REMOVETHIS_ and replace \' with \` below)


# - - -
# REMOVETHIS_title: "'r REMOVETHIS_params$MVNDR_NBR'"
# output:  html_document:
# REMOVETHIS_params:
#   MVNDR_NBR: NA
#   MVNDR_NM: NA
# - - -

This document  provides a summary of "' r REMOVETHIS_params$MVNDR_NM'" performance within in QC
```

## Useful tricks and tips


### In RStudio editor

In Tools -> Global Options... -> R Markdown

- Choose "Show in Document outline: BOTH Sections and Chunks.
- Uncheck "Show output inline", so you can see it Console as you normally do when running from .R file

In Tools ->Global Options...  -> Pane Layout and Appearance, 
- you can add additional Pan (starting from RStudio 1.2)
- We like it having Console window on left (to see more!)
- Some also like dark theme (eg. "Vibrant ink" diplays comments well, others do not)

### Spliting Rmd in chunks

- Split your long Rmd into small ones! 
- Give them names - sorted / tagged by order and keywords
- For debugging or simplify your work  use `knitr::knit_exit()` r code.
- Use (PART) and {-} when you need to split in part and not to index the page

See index.Rmd of this book. Below is excerpt from them
 
``` 
  # (PART) Community Codes {-}
  ` ` `{r 21_gc_datasets, child = '21_gc_datasets.Rmd'}
  ` ` `
  ...

  # (APPENDIX) Appendices {-}
  ` ` `{r 40_ca_packages, child = '40_ca_packages.Rmd'}
  ` ` `
  ...

  ` ` `{r include=FALSE}
  knitr::knit_exit() # Stop compiling here
  ` ` `
  ...
  
  ` ` `{r 99_some_notready_parts, child = '99_some_notready_parts.Rmd'}
  ` ` `
  ...
```

### Making good use of configuration  yaml header  in  index.Rmd file

See index.Rmd of this book and the other (forked) books in https://github.com/open-canada/




### Conditional execution of chunks


#### From smltar book

#### From geocompr


From https://github.com/open-canada/geocompr/blob/main/index.Rmd.

First you do this:

```

``{r index-1, echo=FALSE}
is_html = knitr::is_html_output()
``
```

Then this:

```
``{asis index-2, echo=is_html}
This is the online version of The R4GC Book.
``
```



#### With Shiny in flexdashboard

You can also use it when you (don't) want to run a Shiny code. See Chapter on [Shiny] 


### Automated compilation of  Rmd files in GitHub using GitHub Actions

See how this is done here: https://github.com/open-canada/geocompr/tree/main/.github/workflows

The `main.yaml` script compiles the source (located in https://github.com/open-canada/geocompr) into a bookdown book (located in 
https://github.com/open-canada/geocompr/tree/gh-pages and viewable at https://open-canada.github.io/geocompr/)
