## Plagiarism detection

Q:  Any ideas/packages/resources (in R) for plagiarism detection? 

 
A: 
A good  place to start is the "stylo" package (https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo - R package for stylometric analyses) which implements a wide variety of recent research in computational stylistics. Plagiarism detection is fraught (insert all of the usual ethical and computational caveats...), but stylo can help you identify passages that are stylistically unusual compared to the rest of the text. Unusualness definitely isn't a proxy for plagiarism, but it's a good place to start.

 
Q: 
Is this focused on English language text? Are there lexicons or libraries for comparison within other languages (e.g., French)?

A: Stylo works well with quite a few non-English languages. French, for example, is supported, as are a number of languages with non-Latin alphabets like Arabic and Korean.




## results from International Methodology Symposium

Two presentations  at [International Methodology Symposium](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/conferences/symposium2021/program) were about Text Analysis with R, with great ideas from both:
 

11B-4 by Andrew Stelmach from StatCan: used  `library(fastText)` -  a very powerful package from facebook AI team for  efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. 

 

11B-2 by Dave Campbell from Carleton U:  used the  approach  that we discussed at L&L on October 9 (based on bag of words cosine distance / correlation) for matching beer products description  - https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc/resources/text/),  but addtionally applied SVD (singular value decomposition) to reduce comparison to  the most imporant words, thus reducing significantly the dimension and speed.

## Resources

Below are most popular textbooks for Machine Learning and Modeling in R.  
Also see Discussion on Text Mining (https://smltar.com/ and https://www.tidytextmining.com/)
 

This one is used in many University Machine Learning courses (e.g. in University of Arizona and many others in USA):

An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R

https://www.statlearning.com/ ( https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf )

 

 

These are on Tidy models (most come with source codes): https://www.tidymodels.org/books/

# Simulation and Optimization

There are a number of R packages developed for complex processes simulations and  optimization problems, including   simulation of queueing processes and resource or performance optimization problems


They were used in the research on predicting and optimizing Border Wait Time at Canadian border.
The codes for it and the research article are available at GCcode (search "border") or by contacting [Dmitry Gorodnichy](index.html#contact).
