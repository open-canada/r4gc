### Interactive Outputs in R without Shiny {-}

26 Nov 2021 - 
This meeting will be dedicated to tools to generate interactive graphs, tables, and other content without Shiny (which, as you know, requires a server to host your Shiny application and which for this reason cannot be easily shared with your clients, e.g. by email)


Here are the most popular ones:

https://rstudio.github.io/DT/ 
https://plotly.com/r/ and 
https://glin.github.io/reactable.
Many worked with plotly and DT, but reactable is another great package, which will make your outputs loved by your clients.
