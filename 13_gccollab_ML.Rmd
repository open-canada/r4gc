for the backgrounder and the demonstration of various DE tasks and solutions.

# Geo/Spatial coding and visualization in R


## Resources

There's much effort  across many GC departments to analyze and visualize  geo-data. This discussion is the place to share your results, ideas or problems related to the problem.

 

Below is a great resource to start, which also provides a nice explanation on why R is believed to be the best language to do this kind of work. 

 
Geocomputation with R, a book on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling.


The online version of the book is hosted at https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net and kept up-to-date by GitHub Actions

 
## Federal Geospatial Platform

From https://gcconnex.gc.ca/discussion/view/84695812/data-federation-federation-des-donnees

 

Yukonâ€™s open geospatial data is now searchable on the Federal Geospatial Platform (FGP) (https://gcgeo.gc.ca/) and on Government of Canada Open Maps Portal. Check it out !

 

With the addition of Yukon's resources, the FGP now offers over 5,000 datasets available to discover and download, for public servants and Canadians, all in one location.

 

Wondering how to create a map with your data? We can help you do so, from A to Z, at no cost. Contact us at nrcan.geoinfo.rncan@canada.ca

 
## Tutorials 
 
Check codes and notes for the two Tutorials that we had on this subject this summer:

## Dealing with memory issues

A blog post that illustrates a few ways to avoid overloading R's memory when working with large spatial objects (here's looking at you, 30-m land cover map of North America!).


https://www.ecologi.st/post/big-spatial-data/

 

The two other posts on that blog also have some really nice tips for general R coding. 


## Canadian geo-data

Useful code and R packages from public domain to work with Canadian geo-data. 

From https://mountainmath.ca

- tongfen: Convenience functions for making data on different geometries, especially Canadian census geometries, comparable.
- cancensus : R wrapper for calling CensusMapper APIs

# Text Analysis in R

https://gccollab.ca/discussion/view/7404441/text-analysis-in-r

## Open source textbook

https://slcladal.github.io/topicmodels.html, https://slcladal.github.io/textanalysis.html
 
Also, a list of related resources and codes for text mining (including Web Scraping)  are collected here: https://github.com/gorodnichy/LA-R-text


## Plagiarism detection

Q:  Any ideas/packages/resources (in R) for plagiarism detection? 

 
A: 
A good  place to start is the "stylo" package (https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo - R package for stylometric analyses) which implements a wide variety of recent research in computational stylistics. Plagiarism detection is fraught (insert all of the usual ethical and computational caveats...), but stylo can help you identify passages that are stylistically unusual compared to the rest of the text. Unusualness definitely isn't a proxy for plagiarism, but it's a good place to start.

 
Q: 
Is this focused on English language text? Are there lexicons or libraries for comparison within other languages (e.g., French)?

A: Stylo works well with quite a few non-English languages. French, for example, is supported, as are a number of languages with non-Latin alphabets like Arabic and Korean.




## results from International Methodology Symposium

Two presentations  at [International Methodology Symposium](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/conferences/symposium2021/program) were about Text Analysis with R, with great ideas from both:
 

11B-4 by Andrew Stelmach from StatCan: used  `library(fastText)` -  a very powerful package from facebook AI team for  efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. 

 

11B-2 by Dave Campbell from Carleton U:  used the  approach  that we discussed at L&L on October 9 (based on bag of words cosine distance / correlation) for matching beer products description  - https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc/resources/text/),  but addtionally applied SVD (singular value decomposition) to reduce comparison to  the most imporant words, thus reducing significantly the dimension and speed.

# Simulation and Optimization

There are a number of R packages developed for complex processes simulations and  optimization problems, including   simulation of queueing processes and resource or performance optimization problems


They were used in the research on predicting and optimizing Border Wait Time at Canadian border.
The codes for it and the research article are available at GCcode (search "border") or by contacting [Dmitry Gorodnichy](index.html#contact).
