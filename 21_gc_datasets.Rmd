# Accessing Open Data Canada databases {#gc-data}

This section provides code snippets to read, process and visualize various Open Canada databases of high common interest to the GC community.
Where possible, an App is developed to help visualizing and understanding the data.
See also [Shiny Apps](#gc-apps) section of this book.

<!-- ## Ways to access Open Canada Data -->

## With curl, fread, readxls

Many  databases can be accessed via direct link to an .csv, .zip,  .xls file, using the code  shown below. 
<!-- Note, the preferred functions. -->


```
# txt
dt <- data.table::fread ("https://health-infobase.canada.ca/src/data/covidLive/vaccination-coverage-byAgeAndSex-overTimeDownload.csv") 

# compressed Rds
curl::curl_download("https://github.com/open-canada/datasets/raw/main/statcan/13100810-20211206.Rds", "13100810-20211206.Rds")
dt <- readRDS("13100810-20211206.Rds") 

# All other archives
download.file("https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/tbl/csv/13100810-eng.zip", temp) # or using curl::curl_download()
dt <- fread(unzip(temp, files = "13100810.csv"))
rm(temp)

```

## With cansim package

Most Statistics Canada databases can be  accessed using `cansim` package with a code like  the one shown below. 

See [L&L of 2 Dec 2021 dedicated to CAMSIM]()

Note that when StatCan website is  unavailable however (which is often  the case), you wont be able to run any `cansim` commands. 
Hence, most poupular StatCan datasets, such as those we use for R training  and which we building Apps, are also cached at https://github.com/open-canada/datasets, where they can be accessed using the method described above.

``` {r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=T}
library(cansim)`
search_cansim_cubes("Vital") # or search_cansim_tables("Vital")
dt <- cansim::get_cansim("13-10-0810-01")  %>% data.table::setDT(dt)`
```



## Via API using `library(ckanr)`


Many databases can also be accessed using `ckanr` package (e.g.  Open Ontario Database), as shown in  the code below. 

See [L&L in June dedicated to CKAN](https://github.com/open-canada/lunch_and_learn_opengov/) to learn more.
See also [this blog](https://rpubs.com/Jamesmurray1/594450)

```{r eval=T, include=FALSE, echo=T}
library(ckanr)

ckanr_setup(url = "https://data.ontario.ca/")
resource_search(q = "name:Vaccin")$results  # COVID, Vital, Hospital

res <-resource_show(id ="274b819c-5d69-4539-a4db-f2950794138c")
res$url
destfile <- "Hospitalizations by vaccination status.csv"
curl::curl_download(res$url, destfile)


```

  Description: Compiled daily reported data on COVID-19 testing and outcomes in Ontario. Blank cells represent values that were not reported.

As of November 12, 2021, routine Variants of Concern (VOC) PCR testing of positive COVID-19 samples is no longer being conducted. All eligible positive COVID-19 samples will now be forwarded for whole genome sequencing.  Starting on November 16, 2021, VOC data will not be reported in Status of COVID-19 cases in Ontario.

Data on VOC can be found on Public Health Ontario's [COVID-19 Variants of Concern (VOCs)](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/diseases-and-conditions/infectious-diseases/respiratory-diseases/novel-coronavirus/variants).

  Name: Hospitalizations by vaccination status
  Description: * This is a new data collection and the data quality will continue to improve as hospitals continue to submit data.
* In order to understand the vaccination status of patients currently hospitalized, a new data collection process was developed and this may cause discrepancies between other hospitalization numbers being collected using a different data collection process.
* Data on patients in ICU are being collected from two different data sources with different extraction times and public reporting cycles. The existing data source (Critical Care Information System, CCIS) does not have vaccination status. 
* Historical data for hospitalizations by region may change over time as hospitals update previously entered data.
* Due to incomplete weekend and holiday reporting, vaccination status data for hospital and ICU admissions is not updated on Sundays, Mondays and the day after holidays
* Unvaccinated is defined as not having any dose, or between 0-13 days after administration of the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine
* Partially vaccinated is defined as 14 days or more after the first dose of a 2-dose series COVID-19 vaccine, or between 0-13 days after administration of the second dose
* Fully vaccinated is defined as 14 days or more after receipt of the second dose of a 2-dose series COVID-19 vaccine

# Performance-related databases

## PSES Results interactive analysis and visualization: 

URL: <https://open-canada.github.io/Apps/pses> 
<!-- (mirror:  https://itrack.shinyapps.io/PSES/, use case: https://itrack.shinyapps.io/PSES-CBSA-SE).   -->
Source: https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc/codes/pses


<!-- It illustrates the power of Data Science and Visualization (when implemented for the purpose). It uses the concept of concept of Vertical vs. Horizontal comparison of results, which is most insightful when one needs to find out where (or when) exactly the problem is (or was) in an Organization. -->


No other Open Canada data is of as much common interest across the government as the PSES results [^11]. These data contain the information about all GC departments, their organizational structure and performance. A Shiny App prototype is developed to perform three most desired tasks one wished to do with these data (see Figure):

[^11] https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/public-service-employee-survey.html

1. Vertical result tracking: results comparison across an organization, automated detection and visualization of the performance variation across the organization - for any given PSES question.
2. Horizontal results tracking:  results comparison over time - for any given unit,  in comparison to the organization and Public Service averages
3. Performance summary by theme:  automated generation of report cards that show the performance at each level of the organization for each of theme and in relation to the rest of the organization and Public Service average.
4. Automated generation of full report with detailed comparative analysis and recommendations: for each unit and each level of organization

Key functionalities of the PSES App prototype: a) vertical results tracking - for any question over entire organization, b) horizontal results tracking - for any unit over time, and c)  performance report summary - for each unit, by theme, and in comparison to the Public Service average (shown as crosses) and other units within organization (shown as small dots). The results can be displayed filtered and sorted by score, ranking percentile, org. structure, number of responses, by theme or question.

## TIP requests dataset 

<!-- URL: <https://open-canada.github.io/Apps/atip> (mirror: https://rcanada.shinyapps.io/TBS-ATI-NLP/).    -->



Another Open Canada dataset that relates to the performance of many GC departments is the ATIP requests dataset [^22]. An interactive Natural Language Processing (NLP) application has been developed to enable the analysis and visualization  of these requests for each participating department  (see Figure 2). Its functionalities include: statistics summary,  automated key-words and topic extraction using N-grams, document term matrix and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. The topics can be visualized as word-clouds or as graphs that connect the related words.

 [^22] https://open.canada.ca/en/search/ati.
 
 See “Text Mining with R!” by Julia Silge and David Robinson (https://www.tidytextmining.com) for definitions of the terms.

Figure 2. Key functionalities of the ATIP App: a) department specific bi-variable statics (such as dispositions by year, shown in the image), b) department specific key topics, visualized as correlated terms graphs , c) key topics for each participating department, visualized as N-gram frequency bars (such as 2-gram, or two-word combination, shown in the image).

This App (shown in Figure 4) combines Open geo-spatial data with Open historical and current border wait times data to predict and visualize delays at Canadian land border crossings. The App is included  (entitled iTrack-Border) in the Open Canada Apps Gallery at https://open.canada.ca/en/apps,  where more information about it can be found.
