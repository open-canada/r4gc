(from <https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/03/03/2021-r-conferences>)

-   Cascadia RConf 2021 (June 4 - 5), a jewel of a regional R conference for its first three years, was canceled in 2020. It is back this year as a virtual event. The Call for Presentations is open.

-   useR! 2021 (July 5 - 9) has an outstanding lineup of keynote speakers. The program is very likely to make US based attendees night-owls

-   EARL Conference 2021 (September 6 - 10), the premier R in industry event, will be online this year. The call for abstracts is already open.
