<!-- This is the workbook of the _R4GC (Use R!) Community_. -->

<!-- ## Book source and credits -->

This book is prepared as part of the R4GC Community  skill enhancing and knowledge gathering  exercise. 

It  aims at consolidating the knowledge-based that is being gathered by the R4GC Community spread across various R4GC community portals and discussions.

It also serves to illustrate - as always with source code - one of the most powerful 
features of R, which is 
<!-- the capability to collaboratively develop data science codes and reports using RMarkdown. -->
the collaborative peer-reviewed development of data science codes and reports using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## Contributors {.unnumbered}


<!-- R4GC is a collaborative effort of many people who have contributed to the development of the codes and knowledgebase that is gathered in the R4GC portals and highlighted in this paper: Jonathan Dench, Joseph Stinziano, Henry Luan, Eric Littlewood, Philippe-Israel Morin, Tony Machado, Maxime Girouard, Martin Jean, Tim Roy, Dejan Pavlic, Utku Suleymanoglu.

### Chatham House Rule  {-}


<!-- Chatham House Rule for dialogue events {-} -->


This book is prepared using [the Chatham House rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule).
The Chatham House Rule helps create a trusted environment to understand and resolve complex problems through dialog and timely open communication. 
Its guiding spirit is: share the information you receive, but do not reveal the identity of who said it. Hence,  no attributions are made and the identity of speakers
and participants is not disclosed.
It is based on the views and codes
contributed by community members as part of onging community events interactions. Offered as
a means to facilitate the discussion, the document does not constitute
an analytical document, nor does it represent any formal position of any
organisation involved.

## History {-}


<!-- R4GC Community {-} -->

R4GC Community (formerly called "Use R!" GCCollab community) 
was created in March 2021 to bring together the R users across the Government of Canada.
Here we gather and curate the knowledgebase related to the use of  R  within the Government of Canada. 
Everyone is welcome to join, whether you are an advanced R user, just starting learning it, or simply want to learn more about data science and how it is done.


The idea to create this group came after the [GC Data2021 Conference](https://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/events/data-conference2021) [Data Literacy Fest workshop on Data Engineering Challenges and Solutions: Demonstration of Shiny](#gcdata2021).   The highest voted question during the discussion there was : _"How can I get more help for our members to enhance their knowledge and "spread the word" and raise more awareness regard to this tool?"_ The creation of this community group is the answer to this question.
 
By November 2021, the  R4GC  GCCollab group has been become one of the largest active data science practitioners groups in Canada, counting over a quarter  thousand of members. The weekly "Lunch and Learn Data Science with R" meetups organized by the R4GC Community have been attended by data practitioners from over twenty government departments,  and generated
hundreds of questions/answers, a dozen of tutorials, multiple open to use applications, and  thousands of line of open code. 
On October 29, 2021, the work of this group was presented at the  [2021 International Methodology Symposium](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/conferences/symposium2021/index).

This book aims at consolidating all knowledgebase gathered by the R4GC Community at its  portals and meetups

## Lunch and Learn meetups {-} 
<!-- ## "Data Science with R" Lunch and Learn meetups {-} -->

_"Building advanced Data Science skills using R, together - one meeting at a time!_" 


These  informal meetings are organized weekly during Friday lunch time (from 12:05 to 12:55). 
There data scientists wanting to upscale their knowledge of R and other Data Science related subjects get together to show and discuss their R codes and share their data coding tricks and methodologies.
Normally, each  session is focused on a particular subject or project with the codes shared on GCcode.

No registration is required to join the meeting.  However, in order to view the notes and  video-recordings from these meetups, you need to join this sub-group: https://gccollab.ca/groups/about/7855030. 
For Agenda and Dial-in MS Teams numbers please see Group Events page at https://gccollab.ca/event_calendar/group/7391537.


 
## Community portals {-}

The R4GC community makes used of the following colloaborative platforms provided by Share Services Canada.

<!-- This book aims at consolidating the knowledge spread across various R4GC community portals, described below. -->


###  GCcode group - r4gc {-}

URL: https://gccode.ssc-spc.gc.ca/r4gc

GCcode is the GitLab solution that is accessible from within the GC network. As such, it allows one to view and update (pull and push) codes and documentation with a single click of button on a GC laptop from an RStudio. The tutorial on how to do it is developed. The 'r4gc' group has been created wihin GCcodes, where the codes, tutorials and other resources are gathered. It contains three main folders:

 

- /codes. - This is where "raw" (not-reviewed, unedited) R codes contributed by GC community are uploaded. Currently, this includes codes for analyzing and visualizing PSES (Public Service Employee Survey) results, ATIP requests, COVID-19 statistics, and various codes for ease of day to day work and maintenance. Some codes are readily available to become packages, some are short code snippets taken from various blogs,  question and answer portals, such as www.stackoverflow.org and www.rseek.org, and open-source textbooks.

- /gc-packages. - This is where the work on packages being developed from the submitted "raw" codes is happening. Currently it includes repositories for building packages to process PSES results, COVID-19 data, and the utility functions package for data engineering and efficient data processing.

- /resources. - This where the rest of knowledge-base is gathered, including the tutorials, slides, and codes presented at the community weekly ‘Lunch and Learn’ meetups.

### GCcollab: R4GC (Use R) {-}

URL: 
https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/7391537/enuse-rfruse-r


GCcollab allows one to participate in the discussion from within and outside GC network (for registered users). This makes it convenient for gathering information from any sources, including those that my not be available from within the GC network. In order to facilitate the curation of knowledge, a number of discussion threads have been created there to address of topics of highest interest for the R4GC community. 
These are reviewed and updated regularly, commonly as part of  community weekly meetups.


### GCcollab Subgroup: Lunch and Learn R {-}

URL: https://gccollab.ca/groups/profile/7855030/enfridays-lunch-and-learn-r-meet-upsfr

This subgroup is created for sharing minutes, notes and video-recordings from the community weekly meetups, 

### GCwiki: UseR! {-}

URL: https://wiki.gccollab.ca/UseR!

This platform is used to consolidate all discussion topics in one place and link them with other data science resources in the wiki space.
 

### GitHub: open-canada  {-}

URL: https://open-canada.github.io/UseR/ 

Inline with the GC policies of open science and open data \ref{open-gov}, since most  information gathered by the R4GC community is unclassified and comes from public domain, a public facing organizational account has been created on GitHub (https://github.com/open-canada) for sharing and growing the R4GC community knowledgebase. This is where  public-facing community outputs are gathered, including the growing collection of Web Apps and codes that were built with contributions from GC data scientists using open source tools and data. 


#### GitHub (Apps repository) {-}

https://github.com/open-canada/Apps 

<!-- This pa -->

### Slido (r4gc) {-}

URL: https://sli.do.  Code "r4gc"

This platform is used for wider audience forums and conferences. A number of polls have been conducted there, in a addition to opening and ranking new questions.

<!-- There are discussed later in this book -->

## About this book {-}

This is book is built using the [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org) R package in RStudio.
It is hosted at Open Canada GitHub repo https://open-canada.github.io/r4gc.
The source code of it located at https://github.com/open-canada/r4gc.

<!-- - similar to many great data science textbooks that have been already published and made freely available on github and bookdown.org and other online platforms -->
Thus built, the book enables easy collaboration, transparency and peer-reviewing.
Additionally, as with any markdown file, in addtion to the output visible in the final compiled html file, it also allows one to gather and save  discussion comments and  draft  ideas that are visible inside the source Rmd file.

<!-- , while generating the output that contains only those ideas that are presently print-ready, while keeping all other, not print-ready yet, ideas still available for interested reader withing the source .Rmd file. Thus looking insde the .Rmd source files, the may not only see the actual codes that generated this book, but also all othe draft ideas or future plans hidden as comments within the same Rmd files. -->





<!-- This book is built using R and Rmarkdown in RStudio. -->

## Other formats {-}

One of the beauties of the `bookdown` R package is that it allows one to generate multiple kinds of outputs  from the same source .Rmd files, such as pdf, epub, and various hmtl formats (single page html, multiple-page two-column and multiple-page three-column formats, with and without interactive menus)
The alternative formats of this R4GC book are available here  https://open-canada.github.io/r4gc/alt: 

- epub: 
- pdf:
- one-page html
- mulpi-page three-colummn website:
