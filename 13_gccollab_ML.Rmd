# Machine Learning and Modeling in R


## Resources

Below are most popular textbooks for Machine Learning and Modeling in R.  
Also see Discussion on Text Mining (https://smltar.com/ and https://www.tidytextmining.com/)
 

This one is used in many University Machine Learning courses (e.g. in University of Arizona and many others in USA):

An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R

https://www.statlearning.com/ ( https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf )

 

 

These are on Tidy models (most come with source codes): https://www.tidymodels.org/books/

# Simulation and Optimization

There are a number of R packages developed for complex processes simulations and  optimization problems, including   simulation of queueing processes and resource or performance optimization problems


They were used in the research on predicting and optimizing Border Wait Time at Canadian border.
The codes for it and the research article are available at GCcode (search "border") or by contacting [Dmitry Gorodnichy](index.html#contact).
